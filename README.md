# Tick-iT-FrontEnd
Tick-iT is a website created for helping people find the venues and events they love at a price that isn't astronomical, or riddled with made-up fees.

## Front-End
This project is divided into front-end and back-end repos to allow simultaneous work on the project while minimizing git issues. This repo is dedicated solely to the front-end.

## Project Description
We will utilize React to create out application. We intend to have a header, main, and footer section, with the majority of content populating the main section in a polymorphic manner. The header will contain nav links and a searchbar. Our footer will contain the GitHub links to each group members GitHub account.

## Planning
We primarily used Figma to plan out our design and implementation of our project.
